# IPCanary

## Description
iOS users can now see the public ip address and other related stats of their device. IPCanary can be used for general curiosity, but more importantly it has been created as an easy way for VPN users to verify their external IP is what they expect it to be. 

## Usage
Clone and install on personal device using Xcode. When the project gets to a worthy state I will publish it on the app store for easier usage and accessibility.
